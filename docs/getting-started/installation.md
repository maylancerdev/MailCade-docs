# Installation

Getting MailCade on your machine takes about two minutes.

## Download

Grab the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/olakunlevpn/MailCade/releases):

- **macOS**: Download the `.dmg` file

MailCade works on macOS 11+, Windows 10+, and most modern Linux distros.

## Installing

```bash
chmod +x MailCade-*.AppImage
./MailCade-*.AppImage
```

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i MailCade-*.deb
```

sudo rpm -i MailCade-*.rpm
```

## First launch

When you first open MailCade, the SMTP server starts automatically on port 1025. Your inbox will be empty (obviously), and you're ready to catch emails.

No setup required. No config files to edit. Just launch and go.
